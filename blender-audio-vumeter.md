# Vu Meter

This UI tools gives visual information about the audio volume. 

## The problem
In most video editing, animations, lips-sync, we actualy donÂ´t have any data regarding the level or the gain of the audio files used in the scene. To avoid saturated audio outputs or underleveled audio strips, we would need both Main outputs level meter AND individual strip level indicators.
First, we ned to place the level meters in the GUI. The audio section is linked to the VSE, that offers preview window and sequencer view (and both). These window areas ave an option panel (N Key).
