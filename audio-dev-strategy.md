## Development Strategy and Methodology

Keeping in mind that we are **NOT** making Blender looking like a **Digital Audio workstation DAW**, we want to focus on the most relevant audio processing implementation to support the users tasks during Animation and Movie production. My approach is to look at the fundamental audio settings and preferences before going further. At this very beginning stage, a more **advanced preferences panel** is necessary. 

I also consider any changes from the user´s point of view. **A discrete implementation with "no forced settings" is requested**. As long as the user doesn´t look for Audio mixing features and its usage, the default audio setup will apply.

**The final decision was made, regarding 3 focused developments agendas:**
- Preferences and Default Sound Mixer Setup
- Sequencer Sound Strip Properties and Operators
- Advanced Mixer Setup within a new Editor space
