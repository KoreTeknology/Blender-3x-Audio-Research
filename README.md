THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY ME (uriel Deveaud) "AS IS", THE SOURCE CODE GIVEN IN THIS DOCUMENT NO OFFERS ANY WARRANTIES AND CAN DAMAGE YOUR BLENDER INSTALLATION IN CASE YOU TRY TO IMPLEMENT IT WITHOUT CARE, PLEASE, BE AWARE OF!

## Introduction

This current documentation is intended to demonstrate the audio features needed in the context of editing audio files within [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), the well known Free and Open Source 3D application. 
Audio editing functions are currently non-existent in the software and the only dedicated tools are present only in the context of video/audio strip editing in the VSE (Video Sequencer Editor). We want to add specific functions which will make it possible to work on the audio data by offering inputs, processing, control, visualizations and outputs as internal components within the application.

## Ongoing works

- [x] Personal documentation: [Tasks list](Tasks.md)
- [x] Blender Fundation & Audaspace Library documentations: [External References](ext-references.md)
- [x] Operators and Properties: [Gain Control](blender-audio-gain.md), [Filters](blender-audio-filter.md), [Equalizer](blender-audio-equalizer.md), [Compressor & limiter](blender-audio-compressor.md), [Reverb & Delay](blender-audio-compressor.md), [Spatial audio](blender-audio-spatial.md)
- [x] Visualizations: [Vu-Meters](blender-audio-vumeter.md), and others analysers
- [x] Operator Extra: Standard MIDI 2.0 implementation for external control devices
