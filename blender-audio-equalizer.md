# Audio Equalizer

About the EQ, we have here many options:

tri-bands (fixed freqs*) with gain (what i see here in your proposal)
Single parametric band (very used in studio mastering)
up to 12 bands (fixed freqs)
tri-bands parametric (most common type)
etcâ€¦
i would like to give some infos about the fixed bands EQ in case of tri-bands selection:

20Hrz > 500Hrz (-15/+15db)
200Hrz > 5kHrz (-15/+15db)
800Hrz > 20kHrz (-15/+15db)
As well as the gain for that frequencies range, we should have a Q (curve shape for each band), i didnt try with audaspace if the Q will be a constant value, but we can look at.
